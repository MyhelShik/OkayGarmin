# OkayGarmin

**OkayGarmin** is an executable (.exe) with a built-in local/offline voice recognition model (that's why it takes 150 MB of storage).  
The program recognizes voice commands in German and sends virtual button signals to trigger your software to clip, record, or replay using voice recognition.

## How to Use

1. Run `OkayGarmin.exe`.
2. Say the command:  
   **"Okay garmin video speichern"**  
   After that, the program should save the video.
3. If the video is not saved after the phrase, try running the .EXE as administrator.

## Configure Your Own "Keys"

- To set up your own hotkeys, open the `config.json` file and edit the values as needed.
